# iOS SwiftUI sources

These Swift files implement the native UI flows for:

- `@ON-001..003` onboarding
- `@HO-001..005` home/topic selection
- `@SE-001..005` session UI (with local mic monitoring + mute)
- `@DA-001` no long-term raw audio storage (no file persistence)

The OpenAI Realtime WebRTC client is currently stubbed (`MockRealtimeSessionClient`).
